        Playing games helps in maintaining a healthy life and is beneficial in various ways. It improves blood flow, improves concentration, regulates the mind and body, etc. Involvement in games and sports keeps a person physically and mentally fit.
        There are a lot of benefits that we will earn by playing games like they speed up response times, encourage teamwork, stimulate creativity, focus and visual memory, improve strategy and leadership, teach languages and also critical thinking.    
        In fact, playing makes us happy and sometimes bring family together. 
        For my expectation, I want to tell you that my favorite game is free fire. It's been 1 year since I started to play and I really love it. I used to play it on my smartphone and I noticed that it is much better on smartphone than on pc because 
        your moves are way faster but I don't know for the other player. It is just my opinion but in fact the game is good.

    <h3>Android games</h3>
    <p>
        Looking for the best mobile platform for gaming, then Android is the clear choice. With more games available, lower hardware requirements, and more affordable options, there is no reason not to choose Android over iOS.
        There are plenty of Android games you can play with friends so I recommend checking out the most popular titles like PUBG Mobile and Garena Free Fire.
        In fact, android games provide a hight graphics and gameplay too that satisfy all the people who play and some of them are realistic like in a real life though.
        For now, if you want to play these games, you can find them on Google Play Store. Make sure you are connected to wifi because if there is no connection it won't work.
        So when the play store is open, type on the search bar thoses games and you'll find them and you need just to press the download and wait.

    <h3>Computer games</h3>
    <p>
        We know that PC gaming offers superior game titles and graphics. In fact, about the visual quality, PC is the best. Computers can run more powerful software due to their components and sizes.
        Roughly, we have many advantages by having a PC including the ability to customize it, create hotkeys, sharper and more lifelike visuals, superior accuracy with peripherals, and greater ability to modify games.
        For now, I'm going to show you the top 3 games on PC that everyone loves: the first is ROBLOX, second is Minecraft and the third is Fortnite. There are many other but it's just the top 3.
        So if you are interested by these games, I recommend you to check this website because this is where you can download them. Here: ocean of games, world of pc games... in reality there are others but those are the Website
        that frequently visit to download them. When you are in the website, you need just to type the name of the game, click on it and bellow there are some descriptions about the game itself, and after you will find a button download.
        You press it untill it's working, but to know that it's really working, the page must load on the same page, not in another tab I think you know what I mean by that. You just need to wait a little longer and it will start.
