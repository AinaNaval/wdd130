            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <p>
                Playing games helps in maintaining a healthy life and is beneficial in various ways. It improves blood flow, improves concentration, regulates the mind and body, etc. Involvement in games and sports keeps a person physically and mentally fit.
                There are a lot of benefits that we will earn by playing games like they speed up response times, encourage teamwork, stimulate creativity, focus and visual memory, improve strategy and leadership, teach languages and also critical thinking.    
                In fact, playing makes us happy and sometimes bring family together. 
                For my expectation, I want to tell you that my favorite game is free fire. It's been 1 year since I started to play and I really love it. I used to play it on my smartphone and I noticed that it is much better on smartphone than on pc because 
                your moves are way faster but I don't know for the other player. It is just my opinion but in fact the game is good.
