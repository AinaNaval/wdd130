            <h2>Computer Games</h2>
            <p>
                We know that PC gaming offers superior game titles and graphics. In fact, about the visual quality, PC is the best. Computers can run more powerful software due to their components and sizes.
                Roughly, we have many advantages by having a PC including the ability to customize it, create hotkeys, sharper and more lifelike visuals, superior accuracy with peripherals, and greater ability to modify games.
                For now, I'm going to show you the top 3 games on PC that everyone loves: the first is ROBLOX, second is Minecraft and the third is Fortnite. There are many other but it's just the top 3.
                So if you are interested by these games, I recommend you to check this website because this is where you can download them. Here: ocean of games, world of pc games... in reality there are others but those are the Website
                that frequently visit to download them. When you are in the website, you need just to type the name of the game, click on it and bellow there are some descriptions about the game itself, and after you will find a button download.
                You press it untill it's working, but to know that it's really working, the page must load on the same page, not in another tab I think you know what I mean by that. You just need to wait a little longer and it will start.
